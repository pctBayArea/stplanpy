# Welcome to stplanpy

Welcom to the Sustainable Transportation Planner for Python. This package is
inspired by [stplanr](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/), a package for
sustainable transport planning with R [1] and can be used to analyze American
community survey (ACS) origin-destination (OD) data. This
[data](https://ctpp.transportation.org/2012-2016-5-year-ctpp/) is provided by
the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
through their Census Transportation Planning Products Program (CTPP).

Documentation for this package can be found on
[github.io](https://pctbayarea.github.io/stplanpy/source/stplanpy.html) and an
example of how to use the various functions in this package can be found in a
[Jupyter Notebook](https://pctbayarea.github.io/stplanpy-book/).
